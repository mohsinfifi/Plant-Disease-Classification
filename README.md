# Plant-Disease-Classification

Building a multi-view neural network to identify and classify plant diseases. This code uses popular libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, but you may need to adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements.

### Import Dataset

<b> Dataset Link (Plant Vliiage Dataset ):</b><br> <a href='https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1'> https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1 </a> 


## Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased plants.
Organize the dataset into different folders, one for each class (disease).
Resize the images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Step 2: Build a Multi-View Neural Network

Create a neural network architecture that takes multiple views of the same image as input.
Combine these views into a single feature vector or tensor.
Use convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Use a suitable loss function and optimizer.

## Step 3: Training the Model

Train the model using the training dataset and validate it using the validation dataset.
Monitor training progress, and save the best model checkpoint.


## Step 4: Model Evaluation and Testing

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to measure its performance.


## Step 5: Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

To acheive more accuracy and better predictions, fine-tune hyperparameters and the network architecture.
